            The Rhodes piano is an electro-mechanical piano,
            invented by Harold Rhodes during the fifties and 
            later manufactured in a number of models, first in
            collaboration with Fender and after 1965 by CBS.
            It employs a piano-like keyboard with hammers that
            hit small metal tines, amplified by electromagnetic
            pickups.
